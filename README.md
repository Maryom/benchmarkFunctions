# benchmarkFunctions
Benchmark functions written in Scala


## Motivation
While I'm studying master in computer engineering I used optimization algorithms a lot and I need to run them on Apache Spark. So, I need benchmark functions. I found them in Matlab and in Python. I can use Python with Apache Spark, but I fell in love with Scala. I wrote five benchmark functions as I need them. Therefore I created this repo. I hope it will help someone in this awesome world ðŸŒŽ Good luck ..
